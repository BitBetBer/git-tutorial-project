            <li>... I plan out my schedule.</li>

                    <p>Not as many as I should. When Jadon naps at <time datetime="14:00"> 2:00pm</time> or so every day, I squeeze in what I can. My goal is <time datetime="PT1H"> 1 hour</time> per day. I'm doing my best to keep up!</p>

    (If you don't know the width/height, you can check by opening the img in VSC and looking at the black bar at the bottom of the screen.) (2 options for loading efficacy - "eager" - which is the default or "lazy" Choose "lazy" for anything you'd have to scroll to see) ("figure" lets us add captions. The <figcaption/> must be either the first element of the figure or the last element.) -->
